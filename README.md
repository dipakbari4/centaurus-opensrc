# centaurus-opensrc

**Welcome to the open-source version of Centaurus on GitHub!**

The Centaurus is one of the feasible, lightweight to download, easy-to-use
and a robust multiplayer launcher for I.G.I.-2 game ever designed. It was
succeeded by a cute-looking multiplayer launcher, named `GH[]$t LauncheR`. This
software is affiliated to the
[I.G.I.-2 HOMECOMING](https://fb.com/groups/igi2homecoming) community.

I had developed this software by prioritizing the user-experience more than
being specific and verbose. That is why, this multiplayer launcher looks so
attractive that this could be used by anyone.
